I am a student in the 21-month Global MBA Program. I expect to graduate in Spring 2027.
I'm not sure what to do yet for my career, or how far I want to go academically. I just know I want to help my community back in Hilo in one way or another.
Skills: Excel, team communication, teamwork, adaptable
Fun fact: I have a YouTube Channel with close to 11 million views, and 20,000 subscribers.
